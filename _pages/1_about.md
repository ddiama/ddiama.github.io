I have a diverse professional experience in research, analytics and management. I transitioned from analytics role in financial sector to a research scientist and developer in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Data Analytics with focus on aerospace and automotive engineering applications.

Presently, I have started my research and consulting business in CFD and Data Analytics. Having worked at two different multi-national banks in India and at Aerospace research labs in USA, I can offer a wide range of skills and tools and help you scale and streamline your business requirements.

I also provide online tutoring in Math and Physics to high school students, and Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Aerodynamics, and Numerical Methods to Mechanical and Aerospace engineering students. 

My research is focused on studying complex fluid flow and electromagnetic field propagation using established computational methods. I am passionate about Python programming

I completed my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA. My Ph.D. research was focused on investigating efficient numerical methods to computationally simulate the propagation of electromagnetic waves for aerospace applications. I earned my Master degree in Automobile Engineering from Amity University, Noida, India and Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from RGPV, Bhopal, India.

I am presently open to research and consulting assignments and collaborations.
