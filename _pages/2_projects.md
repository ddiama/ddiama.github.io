#### **Research Projects**

###### Ongoing
* Conceptual design of hyrid-electric small commuter aircraft 
  * Development of a Mission and Operational Analysis model with respect to CS-23 certification aspects
  * Development of a Python-based integration framework to include different disciplines (e.g. engine model, electrical power system model, etc.)
  * System-level assessment studies to explore the design trade-offs when employing hybrid-electric powertrain architectures 
* Airframe-propulsor integrated performance assessment of a hybrid-electric aircraft featuring a boundary layer ingestion (BLI) electrical fan
  * Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the fuselage with the electrical fan to understand its aerodynamic performance
  * Coupled airframe-propulsor system-level analysis 

###### Completed
* System-level assessment of a hybrid-electric long haul aircraft featuring two additional electrical fans per wing
* Development of an initialization approach based on surrogate models to improve the convergence rate of the gas turbine performance tool for a range of different aircraft applications
* Investigation of the applicability of machine learning techniques to investigate the thermal loading of high voltage enclosures
  * Conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations using the OpenFOAM open-source software to obtain the necessary training dataset
  * Development of a robust technique blending the conjugate heat transfer simulations with reduced order models to accelerate the speed of the solutions in an accurate manner

#### **Teaching**
* Teaching assistant in ERA303 (Process Optimization) for academic years of 2021 and 2022
  * Responsible for Linear Programming and SIMPLEX method lecture 
  * Responsible for Assignment 2 with topic: Production planning of district heating systems using Mixed-Integer Programming and GAMS software
  * Development of digitally-enchaced classroom to increase student engagement using online tools (e.g. Mentimeter)
