#### **Research Projects**

###### Ongoing
* Conceptual design of hyrid-electric small commuter aircraft 
* Development of a mission and operational analysis model with respect to CS-23 certification aspects for hybrid-electric electric powertrain architectures
* Involved in the development of a Python-based integration framework to include different disciplines (e.g. engine model, electrical power system model, etc.)
* System-level assessment studies to explore the design trade-offs when employing hybrid-electric powertrain architectures 
* Airframe-propulsor integrated performance assessment of a hybrid-electric aircraft featuring a boundary layer ingestion (BLI) electrical fan
* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the fuselage with the electrical fan to understand its aerodynamic performance

###### Completed
* System-level assessment of a hybrid-electric long haul aircraft featuring two additional electrical fans per wing
* Development of an initialization approach based on surrogate models to improve the convergence rate of the gas turbine performance tool for a range of different aircraft applications
* Investigation of the applicability of machine learning techniques to investigate the thermal loading of high voltage enclosures
* Conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations using the OpenFOAM open-source software to obtain the necessary training dataset
* Development of a robust technique blending the conjugate heat transfer simulations with reduced order models to accelerate the speed of the solutions in an accurate manner
* Participation in Formula Student competitions: involed in the design, manufacture and testing of a single-seater formula car
