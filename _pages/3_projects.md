#### **Research Projects**
* Developing an open-source package in Python programming language for students to learn numerical methods in CFD and coding.
* Implementation of electron transpiration module in the legacy hypersonic flow simulation code.  
* Numerical modeling and solver development for electromagnetic wave propagation within non-dispersive and dispersive (biological) media.  
* Design and analysis of a golf club driver using ANSYS-Fluent.  
* Experimental evaluation of aerodynamic properties of a subscale delta wing race car.
* Development of a simulation tool in MATLAB/Simulink for calculating heating and cooling loads inside the car cabin.
* Pressure measurement on the upper surface of a subscale car model inside the wind tunnel.
* Implementation of Statistical Process Control (SPC) for quality control of car outer body panels. 

#### **Teaching and Mentoring**
* Mentored a group of five undergraduate student in the Design, Build and Fly competition. They secured 2nd position in the competition. (August 2016 â€“ May 2017)
* Tutoring undergraduate students for last 5 years in coursework such as Heat Transfer, Fluid Dynamics, Aerodynamics, Introduction to Atmospheric Flights, and Computational Fluid Dynamics.
* Assisted my PhD advisor in mentoring and providing assistance to students in CFD coursework.
