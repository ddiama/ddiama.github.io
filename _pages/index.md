Dr. Vishal Sharma conducts investigations on the development and utilization of computational methods for studying complex physical phenomena occuring in Aerospace Engineering. Alongside, he offers consultation to small-scale businesses in India to scale and streamline their operations using modern technological solutions. He also tutors Math and Physics to high school students, and Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Aerodynamics, and Numerical Methods to Mechanical and Aerospace engineering students.

Vishal is a Python programming enthusiast and the original author of NAnPack -- an open-source tool developed in Python for students to learn CFD methods. The development version of this package is available for download on Python Packaging Index (PyPI) and on my GitHub repository - [project-NAnPack](https://github.com/vxsharma-14/project-NAnPack).
