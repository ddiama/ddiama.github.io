Writing emails to professors/PIs for seeking an MS research, PhD or a postdoc position can be a daunting task. Through this post, I want to share the tiny details on writing solicited or unsolicited emails to Professors/PIs based on my experiences. Successful applications require a lot of preparation and hopefully this article will give you some insights to write an impressive email.

At this point, I will ask you to consider my learnings and suggestions only as a helpful guide and not construe it as a standard set of instructions on this topic.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Don't send generic emails.

First and foremost thing to remember is -- don't send generic emails or it will probably land in their spam folder.

When you send the same generic email to professors without giving much thought or without doing your own research about their work, lab facilities etc., they will know it and your email will be moved to the spam or trash folder.

Here is an example below of a generic email.

There is no personalization whatsoever in the above example email which will do more harm than good to your application.

### Research about prospective PIs and their labs.

Do your research on PIs and their labs in which you are interested to work.**

Whether you are emailing a PI for an advertised position or writing them to inquire about open positions or upcoming openings in their lab, *DO* a thorough research about their current and past projects, find out about their field of interests. To do so,

1. Visit their lab website as well as their personal website.
2. Browse through their [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) profile.  
    a. Go through the titles of all their publications.  
    b. Next, read abstract of titles of the papers that interests you the most.  
    c. If you find that those abstracts align with your research interests, go through the methodology & conclusions. By doing so, you will now have a fair idea about their research, methodologies and collaborators.  
3. Now that you know about the research profile of your prospective supervisor, draft your email with a personal touch. For example, mention how your research interests and skills align with your supervisor's research and what contributions you can make to their lab. Show them with examples that your skills will help them in their ongoing projects. 

By following these steps, your application will be impactful. In addition, you will be developing rapport with the PI. 
Be specific and don't be too technical. One paragraph with two or three sentences is just what you need. {: .notice--info}

See these couple of example email excerpts which led me to initiate conversation with the PIs.

### Include your CV and a one-page cover letter

Always include your CV and a one-page letter with your email. After you have succeeded in making a first positive impression on your prospective supervisor with your email, it is now the letter's turn to solidify your chances of getting an interview. So it should be very well thought and relevant to the group's research work and requirements. Here you will be expanding the details about the sentences that you have mentioned in the email. Specify in detail how your research skills and experience will benefit the group, what skills will you develop while working with him, how this opportunity will lead you to the path to become an independent researcher, etc.

If you are writing an unsolicited email and have a research idea on a topic that you want to work on, you may also include a two-page research proposal. Remember to do a thorough literature review because you have to convince him that the topic that you are proposing is novel and promising and can lead to securing grants.

### Don't hesitate from sending unsolicited applications

If you are interested in working with a Professor, just let them know. Even if there is no opening with them at the time, there is no harm in sending them the email inquiring about any openings in their group. There is a possibility that they have an open position and they have not advertised it yet. This proactiveness might make you one of the top applicants for the job.

Even when there is no open role in their group, the positive impact that you have made with a personalized email will bring you to their good books. They may redirect you to their collaborators or they may even save your CV and will approach you first when a position opens in their lab. So don't wait when you come across a prospective PI. 

### Schedule your emails thoughtfully

You may want to email them during the morning when they are about to start their workday. Just send the email at the time when you think it will be noticed instead of getting lost in their inbox.

Remember to not email them during late office hours or during weekends. {: .notice--warning}

### Ask them whether his schedule permits time for a short discussion

In your email, always include a sentence asking to speak with them for a few minutes. For example, you may write somethig  like this

> "If your schedule allows, can we schedule a Zoom/Teams call to speak briefly about my research proposal?

### Don't send a LinkedIn request

At this stage in your application process it is not recommended to connect with them on LinkedIn. If they are interested in your application, let them run a search on your professional networking profiles.

## To-dos after submitting your application

### Wait game

Academic hiring is a slow process. After you have emailed them, wait for their reply.

I have set some ground rules for post-submission follow-ups which you may also implement in your job search. If I don't receive a reply within 2 week (15 days), I write them a polite reminder. I also use this opportunity to demonstrate again my interest (only in the right amount) to work with them without being overly excited about it. If there is no response yet, I do the second follow-up after 30 days from the first communication. When there is no response even after my 2nd follow-up, I mark my application as rejected in my personal job application tracker.

Professors are busy people, so I expect that a 30-day time span is a reasonable time frame to receive a response with the status of my application. 

### Don't just wait

In the meantime, don't just sit and wait for their reply. There are tons of Universities worldwide where you can do your research. Search for more Professors, email them using the strategies as discussed above. This is an iterative and a time consuming process but it is worth your efforts if you are sincerely interested in an academic position. It also presents you an opportunity to connect and grow your professional network.

### Know your PI and his lab culture

Just like a PI will do his due diligence before hiring you, it is very important for you to do your due diligence on your prospective PI and his lab to find out how he is as a person to work with, how his lab functions, how many students or post-docs are working with him, etc?

The best way to obtain this information is through his lab members. They will probably give you an honest review about it. Get in contact with them, build connection with them and ask questions. You may also speak with your previous or present supervisor about your application and ask for helpful advise on your application.
