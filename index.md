I conduct research investigations on the development and utilization of computational methods for studying complex physical phenomena occuring in Aerospace Engineering. Alongside, I offer a variety of consulting services and affordable technological solutions in CFD, Data Analytics and Business Intelligence to small and medium scale businesses to scale and streamline their operations. 

I am a Python programming enthusiast and the original author of NAnPack -- an open-source tool developed in Python for students to learn CFD methods. The development version of this package is available for download on Python Packaging Index (PyPI) and on my GitHub repository - [project-NAnPack](https://github.com/vxsharma-14/project-NAnPack).
