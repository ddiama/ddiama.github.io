I'm Dimitra 👩🏻‍💻! 

I was born and raised in Greece 🇬🇷, but I am currently based in Sweden 🇸🇪. 

The passion to learn and understand how the machines around us work led me to study mechanical engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. During my studies, I was fascinated by the complexity of gas turbines and decided to pursue a career in the aerospace sector ✈️. Currently, I am working as a PhD Researcher in MDU, Sweden. 

I aqcuired an interest in machine learning 🖥️ and AI 🤖 during the last years, so I am currently working on learning the fundamentals and try to combine both my passions. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing padel, boxing, painting and portrait photography.
