I am an aerospace researcher and I study high temperature gas-dynamics of the flow-field surrounding the atmospheric-entry capsules using computational methods. I am a Python enthusiast and during my free time I maintain NAnPack[^ref1] library -- an open-source educational tool that I am developing for students in Computational Fluid Dynamics. Know more [about me here](/about/).

[^ref1]: The development version is available for download on Python Packaging Index (PyPI) and on my GitHub repository - [project-NAnPack](https://github.com/vxsharma-14/project-NAnPack).
